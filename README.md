The flag is inside an Ubuntu VM, I ask you to `ssh` into my personal computer, `192.168.33.113` as user `first_time` whose password is `GH{}()[]`, after which you'll be automatically redirected to the VM (which is at `192.168.124.34`). You'll be prompted for confirmation by `ssh` when it's your first time, so you'll have to say *yes* to that.

The flag is stored inside the last updated directory. It is the only human-readable file whose name starts with a `-`.

Hints and a walkthrough will be eventually uploaded; try it out first for a day or two; otherwise, look at the hints. The challenge will end after a week, around the 9th of April.

Commands you might need to solve the challenge: `ls`, `cd`, `file`, `du`, `grep`, `find`, `man`, `help`, `<command> --help`.

When you've found the flag, please mail it to us at [evariste@sc.iitd.ac.in](mailto:evariste@sc.iiitd.ac.in).
