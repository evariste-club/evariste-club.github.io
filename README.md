The flag is inside an Ubuntu VM, I ask you to `ssh` into my personal computer, `192.168.33.113` as user `first_time` whose password is `GH{}()[]`, after which you'll be automatically redirected to the VM (which is at `192.168.124.34`).

The flag is stored inside the only executable directory. It is the only human-readable file whose name starts with a `-`.

When you've found the flag, please mail it to us at [mailto:evariste@sc.iiitd.ac.in](evariste@sc.iitd.ac.in).

If you liked these challenges (we will do more of these if there is enough interest!) you can check out [https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/](OverTheWire).
