    You should <c>ssh</c> into <c>192.168.33.113</c> as <c>star1</c> with password <c>star1</c>.

    For a guide to using <c>ssh</c>, check out the <url href="../hints_for_ellie.html">hints</url> I wrote for Ellie.)

    This time, the flag is not in the machine you'll land in! You're gonna have to search for a server named <c>desmond</c>, and the flag is on one of the services running on <c>desmond</c>.
  </p>

  <p>
    In pointers:
  </p>

  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Search for a server named <c>desmond</c> on the same subnet mask (that is <c>255.255.255.0</c>).
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Find all the services running on <c>desmond</c>, the flag shall be revealed when you enter te correct pin (<em>you will not find it though</em>).
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Search online! That'll be your best friend.
          Take a look at <url href="https://app.hackthebox.com/starting-point">Hack The Box</url>, most of the stuff has just been adapted from there.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

    As always, hints and a walkthrough will be uploaded and updated here.
    The challenge will end in a week, around the 22nd of April.
