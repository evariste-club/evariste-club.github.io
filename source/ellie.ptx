    <p>The flag is inside an Ubuntu VM, I ask you to <c>ssh</c> into my personal computer, <c>
        192.168.33.113</c> as user <c>first_time</c> whose password is <c>GH{}()[]</c>, after which
        you'll be automatically redirected to the VM (which is at <c>192.168.124.34</c>). You'll be
        prompted for confirmation by <c>ssh</c> when it's your first time, so you'll have to say <em>
        yes</em> to that.</p>
    <p>The flag is stored inside the last updated directory. It is the only human-readable file
        whose name starts with a <c>-</c>.</p>
