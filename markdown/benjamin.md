You should `ssh` into `192.168.33.113` as `star1` with password `star1`. (It doesn't the network you're connected to, if you are outside campus, use the VPN.)

This time, the flag is not in the machine you'll land in! You're gonna have to search for a server named `desmond`, and the flag is on one of the services running on `desmond`.

As always, hints and a walkthrough will be uploaded and updated here. The challenge will end in a week, around the 22nd of April.

A non-exhaustive list of commands you might need: `ls`, `cd`, `du`, `grep`, `find`, `nmap`, `nc`, `man`, `help`, `<command> --help`.
